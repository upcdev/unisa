    "## Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have had experience with programming in other languages, such as Java, you may know that data in a program can be primitive types (such as int) or can be complex types (such as objects). Python works slightly differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All variables declared in Python refer to objects in memory.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we said that Python had basic types called int, float, string, etc. To be more precise, Python has **classes** called int, float and string and when we create variables of these types, we are actually creating objects. In object-oriented programming, types are classes and instances of classes are objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** in programming is a construct that holds data and has a predefined set of actions that can be executed on the object. In object-oriented programming, we call these actions **methods**. You can think of a method as a function that can be called using an object. When we call a method of an object, we use the object name followed by a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a mixture of stand-alone functions and methods of classes, so it can sometimes be confusing to know how to use them. The following cell illustrates the difference between a stand-alone function that is passed an object as an argument and an object calling a method."
