    "## 2. Variables and types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we will cover the following built-in types in Python:\n",
    "* numeric: int, float\n",
    "* string: str\n",
    "* Boolean: bool\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **dynamically typed** language (as opposed to **statically typed** such as Java). What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables can be used without declaring their type (e.g. integer, real number, string). In Java, before a variable is used, the type of the variable must be declared upfront and when it is used, the checking of whether the use of the variable is valid/invalid is done at compile-time. For example, it is valid to multiply two numbers together, but invalid to multiply two strings together. In statically typed languages, this kind of checking happens when the syntax of the program is checked by the compiler. In Python, the type of the variable is determined when the program runs depending on how it has been used up to that point. The validity of the use of the variable is checked only when the program runs, hence Python does dynamic type checking. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate the concept of dynamic type checking through the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run each of the cells below and take note of the output."
