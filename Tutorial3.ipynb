    "In Python, a **dictionary** is a collection that can be used for storing **key-value pairs**. You can think of a dictionary as an **unordered** collection of elements where the elements are accessed using a key. The key is used just like the index (position) is used to access an element in a list. Every element of a dictionary has a key (used for indexing) and a value (the actual data stored in the dictionary). \n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. Write a function called first_duplicate that takes a list as an argument and returns the first element that is duplicated in the list. If no duplicates are found, the function should return None. **Hint:** One way of doing this is to use the count method to see how many instances of each element there are. If there is more than 1, it means that that element is duplicated.\n",
    "2. Write code to test the function first_duplicate with a list of numbers and a list of tuples. If your function does not work with both types, then change it until it does work with these two types.\n",
    "3. Write code to do the following: \n",
    "    3.1 Declare a dictionary that includes entries with duplicated keys but with different values. \n",
    "    3.2 Print out the length of the dictionary and the dictionary itself. What do you notice?\n",
    "4. Python has a built-in function called **sorted()** that takes a collection object (such as a list) as an argument and returns a list of the objects in sorted order. Write code to test the sorted() function on a list of numbers, a list of tuples and a single dictionary object. Write down any observations that you make on how the function works with these types.\n",
    "5. Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter the character 's' to stop. Store the numbers in a numpy array. Print out the mean and standard deviation of the values entered. **Hints:** (1) Use a while loop to input values until the letter s is entered. (2) Append the values to a list in the while loop and create a numpy array from the list after all the values have been entered. (3) The method **std()** returns the standard deviation of a numpy array.\n",
    "6. Write code to create a 5 x 6 matrix of random values between 0 and 1, rounded off to one decimal place. Print out the matrix. Use slicing to extract the matrix consisting of the values not on the outside of the matrix (i.e. the 3 x 4 matrix in the centre). Print out the inner matrix."
